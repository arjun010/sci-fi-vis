On Board the Terror

July 15.

To the Old and New World,

The propositions emanating from the different governments
of Europe, as also that which has finally been made by the
United States of America, need expect no other answer than
this:

I refuse absolutely and definitely the sums offered for my
invention.

My machine will be neither French nor German, nor Austrian
nor Russian, nor English nor American.

The invention will remain my own, and I shall use it as
pleases me.

With it, I hold control of the entire world, and there
lies no force within the reach of humanity which is able to
resist me, under any circumstances whatsoever.

Let no one attempt to seize or stop me. It is, and will
be, utterly impossible. Whatever injury anyone attempts
against me, I will return a hundredfold.

As to the money which is offered me, I despise it! I have
no need of it. Moreover, on the day when it pleases me to
have millions, or billions, I have but to reach out my hand
and take them.

Let both the Old and the New World realize this: They can
accomplish nothing against me; I can accomplish anything
against them.

I sign this letter:

The Master of the World.
